# analytics_chatbot

Hi I am Shashank Mittal.

This repo contains code to a chatbot that I created using Python.
The training model is based on Feed Forward Neural Net with two Hidden Layers and works on 
Rectified Linear Unit Activation Function. For Calculating the Probabilites I a
have Used Softmax function of Pytorch.

Futher I have Created a user Interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted it on my local
server using Flask.
